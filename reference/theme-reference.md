# Theme Reference Page

The `/theme` route inside the client application renders a living style guide that showcases our shared tokens, typography utilities, button variants, and `.prose` long-form styles. Visit this page during development to confirm new UI matches the system design language without relying on hard-coded values. The route is composed from primitives in `client/src/components/ui/` and reflects the tokens defined in `client/src/styles/theme.css`. Use the built-in theme switch in the page header to preview every example in both light and dark mode.
