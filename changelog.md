## 2025-10-25 03:42:06 IST

- Updated documentation to reflect fixed `/api` base path and removed variable.

- Removed MinIO CORS validation from the health check and dashboard to avoid incorrect warnings.

## 2025-10-24 13:00 IST

## 2025-10-25 20:00:00 IST
- Updated the Platform Health header icon to use the primary color for consistency with design guidelines.
## 2025-10-25 11:10:00 IST

- Implemented `client/src/app/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` composing cards, chart, and table with data from the new feature.
- Registered a `dashboard` route in `client/src/app/router/routes.jsx`, wrapped it in `DashboardLayout`, and added a `Dashboard` link in `MainLayout.jsx`.

## 2025-10-26 01:52:20 IST
- Fixed Button `asChild` prop handling in `client/src/components/ui/button.jsx`: implemented child-clone rendering and stopped forwarding `asChild` to DOM elements. This removes the React warning and correctly styles anchor/Link elements as buttons (e.g., GitHub link in `client/src/components/ui/SiteHeader.jsx:29`).

## 2025-10-26 02:57:51 IST
- Simplified the client theme to the stock shadcn/ui token set, updating Tailwind config, global styles, and shared UI primitives to remove custom spacing and color ramps.
