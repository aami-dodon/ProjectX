### Maintenance checklist
- Keep navigation indexes in each folder up to date when files are renamed or re-ordered.
- Remove generated artifacts (such as exported PDFs) after confirming they can be reproduced from the source Markdown.
- Cross-link to the [`scripts/`](../scripts) directory for tooling that converts documentation into distributable formats.
