# Probe Registry

The Probe Registry page (`/probes`) serves as the central catalog for all available probes in the system. It provides a two-panel layout for easy navigation and management.

## Layout

The page is divided into two main components:

1.  **Probe List (Left Panel):** A searchable and filterable list of all registered probes.
2.  **Probe Details (Right Panel):** A detailed view of the selected probe, which also allows for new probe registration.

## Probe List

This panel displays a list of all probes and allows you to find specific ones easily.

-   **Functionality:**
    -   **Search:** Use the search bar to find probes by name.
    -   **Filter:** Filter the list by probe type or other criteria.
    -   **Selection:** Clicking on a probe in the list will display its details in the right-hand panel.

## Probe Details Panel

This panel serves two functions: displaying details of a selected probe and allowing for the registration of new probes.

-   **When a Probe is Selected:**
    -   The panel shows detailed information about the selected probe, such as its name, type, description, and current status.

-   **When No Probe is Selected (Registration View):**
    -   The panel displays a form to **register a new probe**.
    -   **Fields:** You will need to provide details such as the probe's name, type, and other configuration parameters.
    -   **Action:** Clicking the "Register" button will add the new probe to the registry.
