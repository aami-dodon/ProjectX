# Probes

The Probes section is dedicated to managing and monitoring the health and status of various data collection probes. These probes are essential for gathering the evidence and metrics required for compliance and governance.

Access to this section is available to users with the "Admin," "Compliance Officer," and "Engineer" roles.

## Features

This section includes several pages for managing different aspects of the probes:

-   **[Probe Registry](./probe-registry.md):** A central catalog of all available probes.
-   **[Probe Deployments](./probe-deployments.md):** View and manage the deployment status of specific probes.
-   **[Probe Schedules](./probe-schedules.md):** Configure and monitor the execution schedules for probes.
-   **[Probe Health](./probe-health.md):** A dashboard for monitoring the real-time health and performance metrics of probes.
