# Evidence Library

The Evidence Library page (`/evidence`) is the central dashboard for managing all evidence artifacts.

## Header and Actions

    -   **Upload evidence:** Navigates to the page for uploading new evidence.

## Summary Cards

At the top of the page, a series of cards display a summary of how many evidence records are in each retention state (e.g., ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, LEGAL_HOLD).

## Catalog Table

This is the main component of the page, a card containing a filterable table of all evidence records.

-   **Filtering:**
    -   Above the table, you'll find several filter controls:
        -   **Search:** Find evidence by its name, checksum, or description.
        -   **Retention:** Filter by the evidence's retention state.
        -   **Tag:** Filter by a specific tag.

-   **Evidence List:**
    -   The table displays all evidence records that match the current filters.
    -   **Columns:** Shows the evidence's **Name**, **Tags**, **Retention** state, number of **Linked** controls, and when it was last **Updated**.
    -   **Selection:** Clicking on any row in the table will navigate you to the detailed view for that piece of evidence.
