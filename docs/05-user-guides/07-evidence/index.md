# Evidence

The Evidence section is your central repository for managing all the evidence required to support your compliance controls. Evidence can be anything from log files and screenshots to policy documents and reports.

## Features

This section is organized into several key pages:

-   **[Evidence Library](./evidence-library.md):** A central library for all your evidence.
-   **[Evidence Upload](./evidence-upload.md):** A dedicated page for uploading new evidence.
-   **[Evidence Retention](./evidence-retention.md):** (Coming soon) Manage retention policies for your evidence.
-   **[Evidence Details](./evidence-details.md):** A detailed view of a specific piece of evidence.
