# Tasks

The Tasks section is your personal workspace for managing all assigned tasks, such as evidence requests or review assignments.

Access to this section is available to users with the "Admin," "Compliance Officer," and "Operator" roles.

## Features

This section provides a few different ways to view and manage your tasks:

-   **[Task Inbox](./task-inbox.md):** A traditional list-based view of all your tasks.
-   **[Task Board](./task-board.md):** A Kanban-style board for visualizing your tasks as they move through different stages.
-   **[Task Details](./task-details.md):** A detailed view of a single task.
