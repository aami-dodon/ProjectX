# Task Board

The Task Board page (`/tasks/board`) provides a Kanban-style interface for visualizing and managing your tasks. This view is ideal for tracking the progress of tasks as they move through your workflow.

## Layout

The board is organized into several columns, each representing a different status in the task lifecycle.

-   **Columns:**
    -   OPEN
    -   IN PROGRESS
    -   AWAITING EVIDENCE
    -   PENDING VERIFICATION
    -   RESOLVED

Each column is highlighted with a different color accent and displays a badge with the count of tasks currently in that status.

## Task Cards

Each task is represented as a card within a column.

-   **Information Displayed on a Card:**
    -   **Title:** The title of the task.
    -   **Owner and Priority:** The name of the assigned owner and the task's priority level.
    -   **Due Date:** The SLA due date for the task, if applicable.
-   **Drag Handle:** A grip handle is visible on each card, indicating that it can be moved.

## How to Use the Task Board

The primary interaction on this page is dragging and dropping tasks between columns.

-   **To Update a Task's Status:**
    1.  **Click and Hold:** Click and hold the task card you want to move.
    2.  **Drag:** Drag the card to the column that represents its new status.
    3.  **Drop:** Release the mouse button to drop the card into the new column.

-   **Result:**
    -   When you drop a card into a new column, the task's status is automatically updated in the system. You will receive a notification confirming that the task has been moved to the new status.
