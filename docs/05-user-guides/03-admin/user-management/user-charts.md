# User Charts

The User Charts section provides two visual representations of user data, allowing for quick insights into the composition and growth of your user base.

## Status Distribution

This component is a **Pie Chart** that visualizes the breakdown of all users by their current status.

-   **How to Read:**
    -   Each colored segment of the pie represents a different user status (e.g., Active, Pending Verification, Suspended, Invited).
    -   Hovering over a segment will display a tooltip with the exact number of users in that status.
-   **Total Users:**
    -   The center of the chart displays the total number of users in the system, providing an immediate summary.

## Growth Overview

This component is an **Area Chart** that tracks the number of new user registrations over time.

-   **How to Read:**
    -   The chart plots the number of new registrations on a timeline. This helps you identify trends in user sign-ups.
-   **Interactive Time-Range Filter:**
    -   You can change the time period displayed by the chart using the filter controls at the top-right.
    -   Available options are: "Last 3 months," "Last 30 days," and "Last 7 days." Selecting an option will dynamically update the chart to reflect the chosen period.
