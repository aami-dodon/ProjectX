# User Management Dashboard

The User Management dashboard provides a centralized location for administrators to view, manage, and audit user accounts.

## Components

The dashboard is composed of three main sections:

-   **[User Statistics](./user-statistics.md):** A series of cards displaying high-level counts of users by status.
-   **[User Charts](./user-charts.md):** Visual charts that provide insights into user status distribution and registration trends.
-   **[User Table](./user-table.md):** A detailed and interactive table for viewing, managing, and auditing all users in the system.
