# Data Table

The Data Table is a powerful and interactive component on the Home page that allows you to view and manage detailed data.

## Features

The table is organized into several tabs, each providing a different view of the data.

### Outline Tab

This is the primary view of the table and includes the following features:

- **Interactive Table:** Displays data in a sortable, paginated table.
- **Row Selection:** You can select one or more rows using the checkboxes on the left.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** You can reorder rows by clicking and dragging the drag handle on the left of each row.
- **Inline Editing:** Some fields, like "Target" and "Limit," can be edited directly in the table.
- **Customizable Columns:** You can show or hide columns using the "Customize Columns" button.
- **Row Actions:** Each row has a menu with actions like "Edit," "Make a copy," "Favorite," and "Delete."
- **Detailed Drawer View:** Clicking on the "Header" link in a row opens a drawer from the side, providing a more detailed view of the item, including a nested chart and additional information. You can also edit the item's details from this view.

### Other Tabs

- **Past Performance:** This tab is a placeholder for future functionality.
- **Key Personnel:** This tab is a placeholder for future functionality.
- **Focus Documents:** This tab is a placeholder for future functionality.

## How to Use

- **Navigate:** Use the tabs at the top of the component to switch between different data views.
