# Interactive Chart

Below the Section Cards on the Home page is an interactive area chart that visualizes "Total Visitors" over time.

## Features

- **Data Visualization:** The chart displays two series of data: "Desktop" and "Mobile" visitors, stacked in an area chart format.
- **Interactive Tooltip:** Hovering your mouse over the chart will display a tooltip with the specific values for "Desktop" and "Mobile" visitors for that date.
- **Time Range Filter:** You can change the time range of the data displayed using the filter options at the top-right of the chart.

## How to Use

1.  **View Visitor Data:** The chart displays the total number of visitors, with different colors representing desktop and mobile users.
2.  **Inspect a Specific Date:** Move your mouse cursor across the chart. A vertical line and a tooltip will appear, showing you the exact visitor numbers for the date you are hovering over.
3.  **Change the Time Range:**
    *   On a desktop browser, you can click on the "Last 3 months," "Last 30 days," or "Last 7 days" buttons to change the time period.
    *   On a mobile device, a dropdown menu is available to select the desired time range.

*Note: The data displayed in this chart is currently representative and will be connected to live data in a future update.*
