# Control Health

The Control Health dashboard (`/dashboards/control-health`) provides a visual overview of the performance of your compliance controls, helping you quickly identify areas that require attention.

## Filters

A dedicated card at the top of the page allows you to filter the data displayed on the dashboard.

-   **Domain:** Filter the results to a specific compliance domain.
-   **Owner Team:** Filter by the team that owns the controls.
-   **Apply Filters:** Click this button to apply your selected filters.

## Main Components

### Control Heatmap

-   **Purpose:** This is the primary visualization on the page. It displays a heatmap where each cell represents a control, and the color of the cell indicates its health (e.g., green for passing, red for failing).
-   **How to Read:** This allows you to see at a glance which controls and domains are performing well and which are struggling.

### Spotlight Panel

-   **Purpose:** This panel, located to the right of the heatmap, highlights the specific controls that require the most urgent intervention.
-   **Information Displayed:**
    -   It lists the top underperforming controls.
    -   For each control, it shows:
        -   The **Title** and **Domain**.
        -   The current compliance **Score**.
        -   A summary of associated remediation tasks: the number of **open**, **overdue**, and **escalated** tasks.
