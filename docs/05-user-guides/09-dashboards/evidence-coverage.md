# Evidence Coverage

The Evidence Coverage dashboard (`/dashboards/evidence`) provides metrics on the freshness and completeness of your evidence collection.

## Main Components

### Coverage Card

-   **Purpose:** This card provides a single, high-level metric for your overall evidence coverage.
-   **Metric:**
    -   Displays the **percentage of controls** that are supported by "fresh" (recent) evidence.
    -   It also shows the raw numbers (e.g., "45 of 50 controls maintain recent evidence").

### Evidence Freshness Table

-   **Purpose:** This component provides a more detailed breakdown of the freshness of your evidence and highlights items that are about to expire.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   **Freshness Buckets:** It categorizes evidence into "freshness buckets" (e.g., 0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days) and shows how many pieces of evidence fall into each category.
    -   **Upcoming Expirations:** It also lists the specific evidence artifacts that are scheduled to expire soon, allowing you to proactively refresh them.
