# Framework Catalog

The Framework Catalog page (`/frameworks`) is the central dashboard for managing all the compliance frameworks your organization uses.

## Main Components

The page is organized into several functional areas.

### Summary Cards

At the top of the page, a series of cards display a summary of how many frameworks are in each status category (e.g., DRAFT, ACTIVE, RETIRED).

### Catalog Table

This is the main component of the page, a card containing a filterable table of all frameworks.

-   **Filtering:**
    -   Above the table, you'll find several filter controls:
        -   **Search:** Find frameworks by their title or publisher.
        -   **Status:** Filter by the framework's status.
        -   **Jurisdiction:** Filter by the framework's jurisdiction (e.g., US, EU).

-   **Framework List:**
    -   The table displays all frameworks that match the current filters.
    -   **Columns:** Shows the framework's **Title**, **Publisher**, **Jurisdiction**, **Status**, and control **Coverage** percentage.
    -   **Selection:** Clicking on any row in the table will select that framework and populate its details into the "Framework Form" for editing.

### Framework Form

This panel on the right side of the page is for creating and editing frameworks.

-   **Create a New Framework:**
    -   Click the "New framework" button at the top of the page. This will clear the form, allowing you to enter the details for a new framework.
    -   Click "Create framework" at the bottom of the form to save it.

-   **Edit an Existing Framework:**
    -   Select a framework from the catalog table.
    -   The form will be populated with the framework's current details.
    -   Make your desired changes and click "Update framework" to save.

-   **Open Detail View:**
    -   When a framework is selected, an "Open detail" button appears at the top of the page. Clicking this will navigate you to the detailed view for that framework.
