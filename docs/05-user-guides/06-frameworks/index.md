# Frameworks

The Frameworks section allows you to manage the compliance frameworks that your organization adheres to. A framework is a collection of controls that are grouped together to meet the requirements of a specific regulation or standard (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).

Access to this section is available to users with the "Admin" and "Compliance Officer" roles.

## Features

This section includes several pages for managing frameworks:

-   **[Framework Catalog](./framework-catalog.md):** A central library of all the compliance frameworks used by your organization.
-   **[Framework Details](./framework-details.md):** A detailed view of a specific framework, including the controls it contains.
-   **[Mapping Matrix](./mapping-matrix.md):** A tool for viewing and managing the relationships between frameworks and controls.
-   **[Version History](./version-history.md):** A log of all the changes and versions of a specific framework.
