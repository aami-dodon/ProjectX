# Control Scoreboard

The Control Scoreboard page (`/governance/controls/scoreboard`) provides a dedicated view for analyzing the performance trend of a specific compliance control over time.

## Functionality

This page is designed to help you focus on the health of a single control.

-   **Control Selection:**
    -   The primary feature of this page is a **dropdown menu** at the top that allows you to select any control from the catalog.

-   **Control Details:**
    -   Once you select a control, the page displays key details about it, including its **Slug**, **Risk Tier**, and **Status**.

-   **Score Trend Chart:**
    -   The main part of the page is the **Score Trend Chart**. This is the same chart component found on the Control Catalog page, but it is displayed in a larger format for more detailed analysis.
    -   **Functionality:**
        -   Visualizes the compliance score of the selected control over time.
        -   Allows you to change the **granularity** (e.g., Weekly) of the time-series data to see different trend perspectives.
