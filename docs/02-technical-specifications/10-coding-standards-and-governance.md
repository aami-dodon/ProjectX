# 10. Coding Standards & Governance <!-- omit in toc -->

>### TL;DR  
> This section defines the coding standards, review processes, and governance practices that ensure consistency, maintainability, and security across the AI Governance Platform’s codebase.  
> It establishes rules for naming, branching, commits, documentation, and reviews to maintain high-quality engineering discipline.  
> The goal is to align all contributors under a unified development culture that supports scalability, clarity, and compliance readiness.

## 10.1 Purpose and Overview

Coding standards ensure that all developers produce readable, secure, and consistent JavaScript code across the frontend, backend, and shared libraries.  
They enforce a shared baseline of quality and maintainability that supports scalability, long-term collaboration, and compliance audits.  

The entire codebase adheres to **JavaScript-only implementation** (no TypeScript), emphasizing simplicity and uniform syntax throughout the platform.

---

## 10.2 Code Style and Formatting

The project enforces consistent style through automated tools and pre-commit checks.

### Tools
- **ESLint:** Enforces syntax, structure, and coding best practices.  
- **Prettier:** Handles code formatting automatically for readability.  
- **Husky:** Runs pre-commit hooks to validate code quality before commits.  
- **EditorConfig:** Ensures uniform indentation and file encoding across IDEs.

### General Style Rules
- Indentation: 2 spaces.  
- Line length: Maximum 100 characters.  
- Semicolons: Required.  
- Quotation marks: Single quotes for strings.  
- Variable naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.  
- Imports grouped logically: external libraries → internal modules → utilities.  
- Avoid unused imports and variables.  
- Prefer `const` over `let` for immutability.  

### Automation
- `npm run lint` checks code quality before CI pipeline build.  
- Commits blocked if lint or formatting errors exist.  
- Prettier runs automatically via Husky on staged files.

## 10.3 Naming Conventions

Consistency in naming helps improve discoverability and code readability across the entire repository.

### Directories and Files
- All directories and files named in **kebab-case** (e.g., `user-service.js`, `framework-controller.js`).  
- Tests mirror source file structure (`<filename>.test.js`).  
- Configuration and environment files follow standard naming (`.env`, `.env.example`).  

### Classes and Functions
- Classes use **PascalCase** (e.g., `UserController`, `AuthService`).  
- Functions and variables use **camelCase**.  
- Constants written in **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (e.g., `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`).  
- React components always in **PascalCase**.  

### Commits and Branches
- Branch names follow convention:  
  `feature/<name>`, `bugfix/<name>`, `hotfix/<name>`, `chore/<name>`.  
- Commit messages use lowercase imperative tone:  
  `add login validation`, `fix auth token refresh bug`, `update linting rules`.

---

## 10.4 Branching and Version Control Policy

Version control follows **Git Flow**, providing a structured release process and controlled collaboration.

### Branch Structure
- **main:** Stable production-ready code.  
- **develop:** Integration branch for upcoming releases.  
- **feature/** branches: Active development of new features.  
- **bugfix/** branches: For minor fixes before release.  
- **hotfix/** branches: Emergency fixes applied directly to production.  

### Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`.  
2. Submit a pull request (PR) once work is complete.  
3. PR reviewed, tested, and merged into `develop`.  
4. `develop` merged into `main` during release with version tagging.  

### Versioning
- Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).  
- Example: `v1.3.2` = backward-compatible patch after minor update.  
- Version tags automatically generated by CI on successful release builds.

## 10.5 Commit Message Standards

Commit messages document intent and simplify traceability for code changes.
