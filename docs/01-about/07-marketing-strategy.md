## 7.1 GTM Objectives

>### TL;DR  
> The go-to-market (GTM) strategy focuses on establishing credibility in AI governance, driving adoption through thought leadership, and scaling via partnerships and ecosystem integrations.

2. **Adoption:** Drive inbound demand from regulated industries and AI-intensive enterprises through content, proof of value, and pilot programs.  
3. **Expansion:** Build an ecosystem of consulting, regulatory, and technology partners to accelerate reach and customer scaling.
