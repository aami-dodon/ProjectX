## 5.1 Pricing Strategy Overview

>### TL;DR  
> The platform follows a flexible, value-based SaaS pricing model combining predictable annual subscriptions with modular, usage-based and add-on options.  
> Entry pricing starts at ₹21,00,000/year, scaling to ₹2,50,00,000+ for large enterprise deployments.

The pricing model is structured to align with how organizations scale their governance and compliance programs.  
It balances **predictable subscriptions** with **pay-as-you-grow modularity**, ensuring customers can start small and expand as their compliance maturity increases.  

---

### 1. Pricing Philosophy
The pricing framework is guided by three core principles:

- **Value Alignment:** Pricing scales with the number of frameworks used, systems governed, and users onboarded — ensuring direct correlation to customer value.  
- **Scalability:** Organizations can start at minimal cost for a single framework and scale up as governance adoption expands.  
- **Transparency:** Modular add-ons make costs predictable; customers only pay for what they deploy and use.  

This hybrid model supports both mid-market and enterprise customers while maintaining long-term profitability.

---

### 2. Core SaaS Subscription
Each customer begins with a base annual subscription that includes access to standard platform features.

| Plan Type | Description | Annual Pricing (INR) | Inclusions |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|

---

### 5. Example Annual Pricing Scenarios
| Customer Type | Setup Example | Estimated Annual Cost (INR) |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Mid-Market Organization** | 1 framework, 10 users, 5 systems | **₹25,00,000 – ₹38,00,000** |
| **Enterprise (Multi-Framework)** | 3 frameworks, 25 users, 15 systems | **₹63,00,000 – ₹1,00,00,000** |
| **Highly Regulated Industry (Private Cloud)** | Dedicated tenant, 4 frameworks, 40 systems, 50 users | **₹1,68,00,000 – ₹2,52,00,000+** |

---

### 6. Strategic Rationale
This tiered, modular model allows the platform to:
- Lower entry barriers for mid-size organizations adopting governance automation.  
- Capture long-term enterprise contracts as compliance requirements scale.  
- Ensure pricing transparency and align revenue growth directly with customer expansion.

## 5.2 Revenue Streams

>### TL;DR  
> The platform generates revenue through multiple recurring and value-added streams — including subscriptions, usage-based billing, add-ons, integrations, and professional services — providing both predictability and scalability.

The monetization structure combines **recurring SaaS subscriptions** for baseline stability with **transactional and service-based streams** that scale alongside customer growth.  
This mix ensures predictable annual recurring revenue (ARR) while maintaining expansion opportunities through framework and integration upsells.

---

### 1. Core SaaS Subscriptions (70–75% of ARR)
The primary revenue source is annual or multi-year SaaS subscriptions for access to the platform's core modules.

- Typical Pricing: **₹21,00,000 – ₹1,00,00,000 per year** depending on plan and deployment type.  
- Subscription Term: Annual, with multi-year discounts (up to 10%).  
- Average Customer ARR: **₹50,00,000 – ₹67,00,000** for enterprise clients after the first year.  
- Renewal Rate Target: **>90%**, driven by framework updates and compliance dependency.  

As customers expand frameworks and integrations, ARR naturally compounds without requiring new customer acquisition.

---

### 2. Usage-Based Revenue (10–15% of ARR)
Usage-based billing complements the subscription model, charging customers for the scale of their compliance operations.

- Metered by:  
  - Number of active **probes or governed systems**.  
  - Number of **frameworks in use** beyond the base plan.  
- Typical Pricing: **₹8,400 – ₹21,000 per system per month** or **₹2,50,000 – ₹6,30,000 per framework annually**.  
- Average Upsell: **₹10,00,000 – ₹21,00,000 per enterprise per year** through incremental usage growth.  

This model captures value as clients expand governance coverage across business units or product lines.

---

### 3. Add-On Integrations and Modules (5–10% of ARR)
Revenue is generated from pre-built integrations and premium reporting modules.

- Integration Pricing: **₹1,26,000 – ₹2,52,000 per connector per year** (e.g., ServiceNow, OneTrust, Jira, Slack).  
- Advanced Reporting & Analytics Modules: **₹4,20,000 – ₹8,40,000 per year**.  
- Forecast Contribution: **Up to ₹12,60,000 per customer annually** in optional add-ons.  

These modules enhance platform stickiness by embedding governance workflows directly into customer ecosystems.

---

### 4. Professional Services (10–20% of Total Revenue)
Professional and advisory services generate both onboarding revenue and long-term consulting engagements.

| Service Type | Pricing Range | Contribution |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Implementation & Onboarding | **₹8,40,000 – ₹21,00,000 / project** | 60% of service revenue |
| Custom Integration Development | **₹16,800 – ₹25,200 / hour** | 25% |
| Governance & Compliance Advisory | **₹4,20,000 – ₹12,60,000 / engagement** | 15% |

Average professional services engagement yields **₹16,80,000 – ₹25,20,000** in first-year non-recurring revenue per enterprise customer.  
While smaller in proportion, this stream supports high-margin consulting and reinforces platform adoption.

---

### 5. Enterprise Licensing and Private Deployments (High-Margin Upside)
Dedicated or on-premise deployments generate substantial premium revenue due to customization, isolation, and regulatory assurance.

- Annual License: **₹84,00,000 – ₹2,52,00,000+**  
- Margins: 60–70% due to limited incremental cost.  
- Target Market: Financial services, government, defense, and healthcare sectors.  
- Renewal Rate: 3–5 year contracts, negotiated with enterprise procurement teams.  

These deployments contribute significantly to long-term recurring revenue stability and serve as anchor accounts for strategic growth.

---

### 6. Long-Term Expansion Streams
As the platform ecosystem matures, additional monetization opportunities can include:
- **Marketplace Revenue:** Commission on third-party frameworks or integrations.  
- **Benchmarking Subscriptions:** Industry compliance scoring and analytics packages (**₹8,40,000 – ₹21,00,000 / year**).
