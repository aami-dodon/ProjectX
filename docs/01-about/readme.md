# AI Governance Platform — About Collection <!-- omit in toc -->

>### TL;DR
> This folder captures the business context, product vision, and go-to-market plans that guide every delivery decision for Project X.
> Use it when you need to understand **why** the platform exists, who it serves, and how it will scale.

The articles are arranged as a narrative—start with the high-level overview and continue through market analysis, monetization, execution plans, and risk posture. Pair this material with the [technical specifications](../02-technical-specifications/readme.md) and [systems hub](../03-systems/readme.md) to connect strategy with implementation.

### How to keep this section current

- Update the relevant article whenever strategic decisions shift; avoid duplicating content that already lives in the technical or systems documentation.
- Cross-link to architecture or runbook materials when execution details change to maintain a single source of truth.
- Remove superseded slides, PDFs, or attachments once the narrative is captured here to keep the collection lean.
