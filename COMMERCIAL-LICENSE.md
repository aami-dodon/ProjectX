# Project X Commercial License Terms

## 1. Dual Licensing Overview
Project X is available under a dual-license model. You may use the Software under
the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) published in the repository's
[`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file. Organizations that prefer to deploy Project X without
the reciprocal obligations of the AGPLv3, or who require tailored commercial
commitments, must obtain a separate commercial agreement governed by these terms.

## 2. Definitions
- **Commercial License**: A written agreement executed with the Maintainers that
grants rights beyond those provided by the AGPLv3.
- **Commercial Licensee**: The individual or entity that has executed the
Commercial License.
- **Authorized Deployment**: Each production, managed service, or third-party
facing environment covered by the Commercial License.
- **Maintainers**: The original authors and subsequent project stewards who
manage the Software roadmap, security posture, and release process.
- **Software**: All source code, documentation, configuration assets, data
models, and other materials distributed with Project X.

## 3. Grant of Rights
Subject to payment of applicable fees and compliance with these terms, the
Commercial License grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable right
to:
1. Use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Software for internal or
external commercial purposes.
2. Offer hosted, managed, or software-as-a-service solutions built on the
Software to third parties.
3. Integrate the Software or derivative works into proprietary platforms,
products, or services.
4. Distribute object code or derivative works under commercial terms without the
copyleft obligations of the AGPLv3.

## 4. License Conditions
Commercial Licensees must:
1. Ensure each Authorized Deployment is reported in accordance with the
Commercial License's usage metrics (such as active tenant counts, request
volumes, or revenue tiers).
2. Maintain security and privacy controls aligned with Project X guidance,
including security-by-design, defense-in-depth, least privilege, encryption in
transit and at rest, comprehensive audit logging, and continuous monitoring.
3. Document deployment architectures and data handling practices upon request to
demonstrate compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.
4. Preserve copyright, attribution, and proprietary notices in all copies and
derivative works.

## 5. Usage Restrictions
Commercial Licensees may not:
1. Circumvent license enforcement, usage telemetry, or security controls
implemented by the Maintainers.
2. Misrepresent affiliation with the Maintainers or imply certification,
auditing, or regulatory guarantees without written authorization.
3. Use the Software to violate applicable laws, infringe third-party rights, or
facilitate discriminatory or unethical AI practices.
4. Publish benchmarking or performance results that identify the Maintainers or
other Commercial Licensees without express consent.

## 6. SaaS Interaction and API Usage
Access tokens, APIs, probes, and connectors supplied by the Maintainers are
licensed solely for integration with authorized Project X environments. Automated
extraction of proprietary content, database schemas, or analytics from hosted
services is prohibited without written permission. Rate limits, security
controls, and audit instrumentation must not be bypassed or disabled.

## 7. Contributions and Feedback
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, contributions submitted to the Maintainers
remain dual-licensed under the AGPLv3 and these Commercial License terms. You
represent that you have the right to grant, and hereby grant, the Maintainers a
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute such contributions across both licensing models.

## 8. Support and Services
Any service-level commitments, managed upgrades, or professional services are
provided only if expressly stated in your Commercial License or an accompanying
statement of work. Absent such commitments, support is delivered on a
commercially reasonable basis.

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR AVAILABILITY. YOU ASSUME ALL
RISKS ARISING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE OUTCOMES, DATA
HANDLING, AND REGULATORY INTERPRETATION.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE MAINTAINERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THE COMMERCIAL
LICENSE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE
SUBSCRIPTION OR SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 11. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Maintainers and their
affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and
expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from or relating to your
use of the Software, breach of these terms, or violation of applicable law.

## 12. Term and Termination
These terms take effect upon execution of a Commercial License and continue
until terminated. The Maintainers may terminate the Commercial License for your
material breach if such breach remains uncured for thirty (30) days after notice
(or immediately if the breach is incapable of cure). Upon termination, you must
cease all use, destroy or return all copies in your possession or control, and
certify destruction upon request. Sections 7 through 17 survive termination.

## 13. Compliance, Audit, and Verification
The Maintainers may request reasonable information to confirm compliance with
these terms, including descriptions of deployment models, user counts,
integrations, and revenue-generating offerings. You agree to cooperate in good
faith, subject to confidentiality obligations, to demonstrate compliance.

## 14. Trademarks and Branding
"Project X" and associated logos are trademarks of the Maintainers. This license
does not grant any right to use the Maintainers' trademarks, service marks, or
trade names except for factual references or as otherwise permitted in writing.

## 15. Updates and Modifications
The Maintainers may update these commercial terms with notice by publishing a
revised version in the repository or via the contracting channel. Continued use
of the Software after the effective date of updated terms constitutes acceptance
of the changes. If you do not agree, you must cease use and comply with
termination obligations.

## 16. Governing Law and Venue
The Commercial License is governed by the laws of the Maintainers' principal
place of business, excluding conflict-of-law rules. Any disputes arising under
or relating to the Commercial License shall be resolved in the courts located in
that jurisdiction, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.

## 17. Entire Agreement
These terms, together with the executed Commercial License and any statements of
work, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Maintainers regarding
commercial use of the Software, superseding all prior or contemporaneous
understandings. Any waiver of rights must be in writing and signed by the
Maintainers.

For Commercial License inquiries, security disclosures, or compliance
assistance, please contact the Maintainers using the communication channels
published in the Project X roadmap and governance materials.
